# Classification of Resturant Images

The objective of this experiment was to use simple machine learning algorithms to create a pipeline that is 

able to distinguish between resturant images.

The raw images are taken from around the Melaka Area, Malaysia. The resturants in question are the fast food

resturants McDonald's, Subway and KFC. This is because of their very distinct Logo's which are easily recognisable 

to the human eye both during the day and at night.


The images were taken using a DSLR camera and converted to black. The image is then cropped fitting the area of interest which is the logo to a size of 500 x 100 and converted to JPG format. These cropped images are the inputs used in the notebook.
